\title{Grid-based recursive thinning of spatial points}
\usage{
gridify_thin(p, cs = NULL, thin.par = 10, reps = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A terra::SpatVector of points.}

\item{cs}{Numeric. Grid cell size used for subdivision. If NULL, a default is
computed from \code{terra::ext(p)}.}

\item{thin.par}{Numeric. Minimum allowed distance between any two retained
records (see thin_records).}

\item{reps}{Integer. Number of replicate thinnings to attempt within each
cell.}
}
\value{
A terra::SpatVector of points after recursive grid partitioning and
distance-based thinning.
}
\description{
Combines grid partitioning and distance-based thinning. Points in cells with
up to 1000 records are thinned using thin_records; cells with more than 1000
records are further subdivided until the threshold is met, then thinned. The
result is thinned again to enforce the minimum distance globally.
